### Administration Guidelines

**Mode of Administration:**
- Face-to-face interviews preferred for accuracy and rapport

- Allow 20-30 minutes per questionnaire (longer for patients)

**Language:**
- Translate questionnaires into local languages (Twi, Ga, Ewe, etc.)

- Interviewers should be fluent in local languages
- Record which language was used for each interview

**Quality Control:**
- Daily review of completed questionnaires by field supervisor
- Random spot-checks during data collection
- Weekly data entry and preliminary cleaning
- Regular team debriefs to address emerging issues

### Data Entry Template

Create a database (RedCap, KoboToolbox, or Excel) with:
- Unique IDs linked to questionnaire types
- Date stamps
- Interviewer IDs
- Data validation rules (skip logic, range checks)
- Regular backups

### Ethical Considerations

- Obtain informed consent before administering questionnaire
- Ensure privacy during administration
- Store completed forms securely
- Pseudonymize all identifying information during data entry
- Maintain separate file linking IDs to names (for follow-up only)
